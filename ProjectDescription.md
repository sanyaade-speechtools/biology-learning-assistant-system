Gene Expression Learning Assistant System

# Project Description #

## Project Background ##

---

<br>Recently, traditional teaching methods for complex biology process is very difficult to understand for students without previous background knowledge. In classroom, teachers also display this kind of process by chalk on blackboard.</br>
<br>Although there are some technical methods to support teachers such as power point, video, voice record and so on, students have to meet one problem which is they could not feel funny with biology learning. And biology studying is too difficult for self learner who is interested in biology especially gene stable. </br>

## Project Overview ##
<br>The project is solving current problems in order to design some funny methods to help professors to teach gene knowledge to students and attract students learning biology. According to requirements from stakeholders, there are main two steps in Gene Expression, transcription and translation, they mainly want to display these two steps clearly and attract students learning biological rules.</br>

<br>The project includes requirement engineering: analysis the problem, understanding the user and stakeholder needs, define the system, managing scope, refine the system define and build the right system. Each step has documents, models and information diagram.The project includes diagrammatic workflow analysis of both new and old systems, and narrative comparisons between analogous processes, highlighting how the new system will improve over the old.The information divulged by the workflows was then used to develop a full database specification, including a data structure diagram and data dictionary.  Finally there is a pictorial specification for the website, outlining its proposed structure and appearance, and how pages will be connected.Supplementary information includes expected system requirements for both users and stakeholders, and an expanded project profile to provide a background to users and the stakholders, and justification for the new systemâ€™s construction.</br>

## Objectives ##
<br>The project displays the whole process by Flash animation, design two games for each steps, and provide on-line quiz to students or other users who want to learning this kind of knowledge. While, the project provides function that allows teachers upload the question bank according to each steps.</br>

<br>The gene stable process has two steps: transcription and translation. Transcription is gene expression from DNA to mRNA. It uses ATCG-UAGC rule and compare with DNA and mRNA from millions of gene unit. After that, the translation which is second gene expression transfer mRNA to Amino Acid which uses different rules. Finally, the Amino Acid is used for generating protein.</br>

## Potential Customer ##
<br>Stakeholder: Biology Professor who want to find a interesting teaching method</br>
<br>User: Students and people who want to learn by self and do not have enough background and feel difficult with current learing method</br>
