== 1.Introduction == 

=== 1.1 Purpose ===
The main purpose of SRS is to describe and collect functional and non functional requirements that have not been described in the Use-cases for release 1.0 of Gene Expression Learning Assistant System. Such as the nonfunctional requirements like: usability, reliability, performance, and support ability.

=== 1.2 Project Scope and Product Features ===
Gene Expression Learning Assistant System helps the biology students to better understand the gene knowledge by non-traditional ways, such as playing games, and provides feedback by the professors to accomplish the aims of learning Gene knowledge. A detailed project description is available in Project Description and TeamSkill3.
