# Understanding stakeholder and user's need #

## Summary of User Needs as Collected from Interviews ##
<br>Interview involved the visitors who are interesting in gene expression, the students who study gene expression, and the professors who teach gene expression. The following are the outcomes from the interview:</br>

### From visitors point of view ###
<br>System should be easy to access.</br>
<br>System should be user interface friendly.</br>
<br>System should provide security.</br>

### From professors point of view ###
<br>Professors should have high-level access permission.</br>
<br>System should provide security.</br>
<br>System should have flexibility to update or create data.</br>
<br>System should keep track of past information.</br>
<br>System should have interactive ability.</br>
<br>System should help to save time and energy.</br>
<br>System should upport interesting ways and materials to teach.</br>

### From students point of view ###
<br>System should be 24X7.</br>
<br>Gene expression information should be easy to remember.</br>
<br>System should be more interesting (not like :PPT. articles)</br>
<br>System should be interactive with students.</br>
